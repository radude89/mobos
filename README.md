# Talk Abstract
With Core ML 3, on-device learning has been fully upgraded. Create ML got its own identity, now being a standalone application and is providing support for types of models such as image classifiers, object detection, sound or text classification.

You can create and train your models very easy. We will check how Create ML and Core ML were intended to work together. After this talk, you will have an overview of models creation and training, how to integrate them in your iOS app and enhance them further with on-device training.

Why is it a good talk?  
I want to provide a demo of an iOS app that has a model created with Create ML via the Image Classifier and make it recognise 2-3 objects on stage.  
Showing people that Core ML 3 has been given a big boost this year, making use of on-device training, for sure will turn into a great subject for this talk. And with Create ML, it has never been easy to create and train your models.
